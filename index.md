### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 

    This lab was fun because it was our introduction lab to computer science. It was exciting to refresh my memory on coding, and the hello world program is a classic. This lab also taught the basics needed to get us jumpstarted. 

 

* Lab 2 

    This lab is also one of my favorites because we had to use strings. We also took what we knew from lab 1 about printing text and used that in this lab. We also used line wrapping and it made our code look a lot cleaner, so it was easier to understand. 

 

* Lab 4, Part 2 

    This lab was probably my favorite because I love using if else statements. It was fun having the program check if the player’s guess was the same as the answer. After all of the code was written, it was fun seeing it all come together. We would just plug in random numbers, and it was cool seeing that the program knew if it was correct or not, no matter the number.
